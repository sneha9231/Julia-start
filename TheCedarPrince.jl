I absolutely adore the attempt at unified documentation like in the SciML ecosystem. The source code is here: https://docs.sciml.ai/Overview/stable/

I have no idea how they really did it, but I think it is a fantastic idea and wish that we could start something similar within JuliaHealth. I think the first step might be to start with MultiDocumenter.jl. Although I am not fully certain myself.
